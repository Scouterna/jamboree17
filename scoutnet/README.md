# Post-camp administration scripts

These where used to keep track of what volunteers where still on site, and when they intended to leave. Because of the 
scale (large number of individuals), connection quality (which was rather bad after the fiber had been turned off) and 
for administrative purposes, changes where performed using CSV files and synced to the registration system using a web 
API instead of the existing web interface.
