# Voucher code tools

This is probably not useful ever again, but as a curiosity: These scripts where used to a) calculate which groups 
had purchased voucher codes and not used them, and b) email these groups the correct number of codes to enter in 
the registration system to cancel out some participation fees.

This should probably be handled in a better way in the future...
